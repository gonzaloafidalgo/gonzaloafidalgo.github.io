When one of my nephews was growing up and learning to speak, he'd have some trouble pronouncing my name and would always call me ``Gonzolo`` instead.

Several years later now, the kid grew up (unfortunately leaving that word's cuteness behind, as he now pronounces it correctly), and I've moved to Ireland where, to my surprise,
``Gonzolo`` is the main way I've been hearing and seeing my name written down
for the last 4 years.

Maybe it reminds me of good moments. Maybe it means that my current quest in Ireland is still in its early stages, or maybe I just like the sound of it.

Either way, I enjoy that word.
